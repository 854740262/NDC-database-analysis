# NDC-database-analysis

We are trying to find the duplication of the drug in the dataset. For example, if two drugs got the same curative effect but they have different name, we could eliminate them from the dataset. Also, if two drugs have same name but different  curative effect, we could clear the data by changing the name of these drugs.
