    "Our dataset is about the drug products in the United States. The reason we collect the data is that sometimes we wish to purchase OTC drugs, there is no list about the dosage and the curative effect, so it is hard to purchase the right drugs. We need to search each individual drug we wish to purchase. Thus, we want to reorganize this raw dataset as a guide of drugs. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The data contains: ProductID which is the concatenation of the NDCproduct code and SPL documentID, ProductNDC which is the labeler code and product code segments of the National Drug Code number, ProductTypeName which is the type of product, ProprietaryName which is the trade name, ProprietaryNameSuffix which is the suffix to the proprietary name, NonProprietaryName which is the active ingredient(s) of the product, DosageFormName which is the translation of the DosageForm Code, RouteName which is the translation of the Route Code, StartMarketingDate which is the starting date of its marketing of the drug product, EndMarketingDate which is the ending date the product will no longer be available on the market, MarketingCategoryName which is the final marketed product categories, LabelerName which is the name of the company, SubstanceName which is the active ingredient list, StrengthNumber which is the strength values of each active ingredient, StrengthUnit which is the units to be used with the strength values, Pharm_Classes which is the reported pharmacological class categories, DEASchedule which is the assigned DEA Schedule number, NDC_Exclude_Flag which is check whether the product has been removed/excluded from the NDC Directory for failure to respond to FDAâ€™s requests for correction to deficient or non-compliant submissions, Listing_Record_Certified_Through which it the date when the listing record will expire."

    "There are several real-world questions we wish to solve; the first question is the data is a raw data so there are a lot of duplication and misleading. For example, the data contains two different drugs but with same curative effect or two different drugs with same name but different curative effect. Also, it contains drugs which is not approved to use today. If people read the raw data and wish to purchase the medicine, the duplicate and misleading parts make people do not know what the right medicine is to choose. The raw dataset will cause a lot of trouble. if people wish to purchase a medicine in a rush, read the raw dataset will waste lots of time on finding the right medicine. Thus, our goal is to make this dataset readable and remove all the misleading and duplicate part so that this dataset will become the guide for people to purchase medicine in the United States. Also, it is easier for doctors to offer prescriptions because the dataset is more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is that we want to make some visualizations about each type of medicine, we want to know which type of drug is popular in our world and which type of drug have better prospects. This can let the drug manufactures know which type of drug they can make in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third is that we wish to combine the same curative effect drug by the OTC drug dosage name, and we want to make the distribution of all the OTC drug dosage name. The reason is that OTC drug is people normally use. However, sometimes before people purchase the drug, they need to know how to use the drug. For example, if someone allergy with capsule they need to purchase other form of drug with the same effect. Thus, it is better to combine the drugs. Also, we want to make the distribution to analyze which type of drug dosage name is the most popular one so drug manufactures based on the type of medicine and the dosage name to make medicine in the future."
